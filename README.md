# Dog Breed Classification with Keras
## Overview
This project is a deep learning-based dog breed classification system implemented using the Keras framework. The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately classify different dog breeds from input images.


## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/data . It contains over 10,000+ annotated images of 120 different unique dog breeds. The dataset is divided into training and test sets, which are used for training and evaluating the model, respectively.

## Model Architecture
The deep learning model used for this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN). The architecture of the model consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features from the input images. The final layers are fully connected (dense) layers that perform the actual classification. The model is trained to output the probability distribution over the 120 dog breeds.

## Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using the test portion of the dataset. Accuracy and other relevant metrics were computed to assess the model's classification performance. Additionally, the model's predictions on new, unseen images can be visualized and analyzed.

## Usage
  To use this project for dog breed classification, follow these steps:

 * Clone this repository.
 * Download the Stanford Dogs Dataset and preprocess it as necessary.
 * Train the model using your dataset or pre-trained weights.  
 * Evaluate the model's performance on your test data.
 * Use the model for classifying dog breeds from images.

## Dependencies
This project relies on the following Python libraries:

  * Keras
  * TensorFlow
  * NumPy
  * Matplotlib
  
Ensure that you have these libraries installed in your environment before running the project and put files in correct directories.
